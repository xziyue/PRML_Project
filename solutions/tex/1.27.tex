\begin{question}{1.27}
	Consider the expected loss for regression problems under the $L_q$ loss function given by
	\begin{align*}
		\ev{L_q} = \int\int \lvert y(\bm{x}) - t \rvert^q p(\bm{x}, t)\ d\bm{x}\ dt.
	\end{align*}
	Write down the condition that $y(\bm{x})$ must satisfy in order to minimize $\ev{L_q}$. Show that, for $q = 1$, this solution represents the conditional median, i.e., the function $y(\bm{x})$ shuch that the probability mass for $t < y(\bm{x})$ is the same as for $t \geq y(\bm{x})$. Also show that the minimum expected $L_q$ loss for $q \rightarrow 0$ is given by the conditional mode, i.e. by the function $y(\bm{x})$ equal to the value of $t$ that maximizes $p(t \mid \bm{x})$ for each $\bm{x}$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}{}
	When $q = 1$, it can be seen that
	\begin{align}
		\ev{L_1} &= \int\int \lvert y(\bm{x}) - t \rvert p(\bm{x}, t)\ d\bm{x}\ dt\\
		
	\end{align}
