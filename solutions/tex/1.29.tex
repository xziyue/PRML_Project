\begin{question}{1.29}
	Consider an $M$-state discrete random variable $x$, and use Jensen's inequality in the form
	\begin{align*}
		f\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{M} \lambda_i x_i \right) \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{M} \lambda_i f(x_i) \quad (\mbox{$f$ is convex})
	\end{align*}
	to show that the entropy of this distribution $p(x)$ satisfies $H[x] \leq \ln M$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}{}
	We know that
	\begin{align}
		\etpy[x] = -\sum_{i = 1}^{M} p(x_i) \ln p(x_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^{M} p(x_i) \ln \frac{1}{p(x_i)}.
	\end{align}
	In the form of Jensen's inequality, it can be seen that $f(x_i) = \ln x_i$. We can easily derive that $f''(x_i) = -1 / x_i^2$, which is nonpositive. That is to say, $f$ is a concave function. Also, it is clear that $p(x_i) \geq 0$ and  $\sum_{i = 1}^M p(x_i) = 1$, which meets the requirements of the inequality. Because the function is concave, when using Jensen's inequality, we need to reverse it, namely t use the form
	\begin{align}
		f\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{M} \lambda_i x_i \right) \geq \sum_{i = 1}^{M} \lambda_i f(x_i) \quad (\mbox{$f$ is concave}).
	\end{align}
	Now it can be seen that
	\begin{align}
		\ln\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{M} p(x_i)\frac{1}{p(x_i)}\right) \geq  \sum_{i = 1}^{M} p(x_i) \ln \frac{1}{p(x_i)},
	\end{align}
	which indicates that $\etpy[x] \leq \ln M$.
